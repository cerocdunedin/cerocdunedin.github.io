We would love the opportunity to work with you to enhance this aspect of your wedding â€“ this is one of our favourite ways of sharing our love of dance!</p><p>The price is $60 per hour session, and most couples have around 4 sessions to learn and polish a dance. We also provide notes and videos of the routine for you, are receptive to messages in between sessions and provide your photographer with a "cheat-sheet" of where we recommend they position themselves to get the best photos possible of your First Dance.</p><p>We choreograph for dancers of any level. If you've never done Ceroc before, we encourage you to come along to some beginner classes first (especially making use of our new student 6 for 3 deal!) to learn the basics. This means we'll be able to incorporate more advanced moves into your routine and you're likely to feel more confident learning the sequence rather than the foundations skills and routine at the same time. Plus, learning to "freestyle" will allow you to continue dancing into the night. However, we've also taught many couples the basics alongside a routine with great results!</p><p>Please see the testimonials section below for how couples find working with us.</p></div>
